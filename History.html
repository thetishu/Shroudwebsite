        <h2>Origins & Early References</h2>
        <p>Claims about the Shroud's earliest history vary. There are traditions linking it to the "Image of Edessa" (the Mandylion) — a revered cloth said to bear a miraculous likeness of Christ in Byzantine and Syriac sources. While some scholars propose continuity between such images and the Shroud, others argue the documentary record only becomes clear in the 14th century.</p>

        <p>Key points:</p>
        <ul class="dot-list">
          <li><strong>Mandylion/Edessa:</strong> A celebrated acheiropoieton (image not made by human hands) in Byzantine tradition; debated whether it is the Shroud or a different relic.</li>
          <li><strong>Documentary gap:</strong> Reliable, continuous documentary links between early medieval relics and the Turin Shroud are disputed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Appearance in Medieval Europe: Lirey and Geoffroi de Charny</h2>
        <p>From around 1354 the cloth is documented in Lirey, France, where Geoffroi de Charny, a French knight, exhibited it. Medieval records show both devotion and dispute: ecclesiastical authorities sometimes criticized or questioned its authenticity, while pilgrims and nobles treated it as a venerated relic.</p>

        <p>The Lirey period is important because it is the first firmly attested public display. The Shroud enters recorded history as an object of devotion, commerce, politics, and sometimes skepticism.</p>

        <h3>Important medieval notes</h3>
        <ul class="dot-list">
          <li><strong>Bishops' concerns:</strong> At least one bishop in the 14th century expressed concern about painted images and possible forgeries.</li>
          <li><strong>Patronage:</strong> The Shroud's exhibitions were often organized by influential patrons, which affected its mobility and visibility across medieval Europe.</li>

        <h2>House of Savoy, Chambéry, and the Move to Turin</h2>
        <p>Over centuries the cloth passed through various hands. By the 15th century it was owned by the House of Savoy. It was displayed in Chambéry (Savoy's seat) until 1578, when it was moved to Turin, where it remains in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist.</p>

        <p>During this period it suffered physical damage and subsequent repairs (notably after the 1532 fire), which are visible today as scorch marks and patches. These physical events also shaped later scholarly study of the cloth's condition.</p>
      </div>

    <section class="section alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Damage, Conservation & Restorations</h2>
        <p>In 1532 a fire in the chapel where the Shroud was kept caused water and heat damage. Repairs included patches and a backing cloth applied in the 16th century. Conservation efforts have been conducted over centuries, with major modern restoration work in 2002 focusing on stabilizing and cleaning while preserving original materials.</p>

        <h3>Conservation highlights</h3>
        <ul class="dot-list">
          <li><strong>1532 fire:</strong> Scorch marks and burn holes documented; later stitched repairs are part of its visible history.</li>
          <li><strong>19th–21st c. interventions:</strong> Cleaning, photographic documentation, and structural reinforcement have been periodically applied.</li>
          <li><strong>2002 restoration:</strong> Careful removal of 19th-century supports and localized cleaning under conservation protocols.</li>

        <h2>Photography & the 1898 Rediscovery</h2>
        <p>When Secondo Pia photographed the Shroud in 1898, the resulting negative image revealed surprising visual properties: a clearer, more lifelike representation when reversed. The “negative” effect triggered renewed international interest and kicked off a new era of scientific, photographic, and artistic investigation.</p>

        <p>Photographic advances changed how the cloth was studied—enabling measurements, comparisons, and enhanced imaging techniques that were impossible in the pre-photography era.</p>

        <h2>20th Century: Scientific Programs & STURP (1978)</h2>
        <p>The Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP), a multidisciplinary team, conducted extensive non-destructive testing in 1978. Their work included photographic analysis, spectroscopy, and evaluation of biological traces. STURP's publicly released reports found features that merited further study, and their data remain foundational in modern debates.</p>

        <p>Important STURP outcomes:</p>
        <ul class="dot-list">
          <li>Extensive ultraviolet, infrared, and photographic imaging was performed.</li>
          <li>Measurements of blood-like stains suggested iron and porphyrin signals consistent with blood, though interpretation has been contested.</li>
          <li>STURP concluded that the image’s exact formation mechanism remained unexplained by then-available laboratory techniques.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Radiocarbon Dating (1988) & Debate</h2>
        <p>In 1988 multiple laboratories performed radiocarbon dating on small samples; the results indicated a medieval date (roughly 1260–1390 CE). This study was widely publicized and interpreted as evidence for a medieval origin, but methodological critiques followed: concerns about sample selection, textile contamination, and patching raised questions about whether the sampled area was representative of the whole cloth.</p>

        <p>Subsequent analyses and reviews continue to debate the radiocarbon conclusions, with some scientists proposing statistical adjustments or contamination hypotheses, while others stand by the original results.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Image Formation Theories</h2>
        <p>Proposed mechanisms for how the faint, superficially-located image formed include:</p>
        <ul class="dot-list">
          <li><strong>Photochemical / oxidation:</strong> Gradual chemical changes due to aging or environmental exposure.</li>
          <li><strong>Thermal / scorching models:</strong> Controlled heating or flash events that alter surface fibers.</li>
          <li><strong>Radiation / vaporography:</strong> Hypotheses involving rapid emission processes (controversial and speculative).</li>
          <li><strong>Manual artistic techniques:</strong> Painting, rubbing, or pigment application — argued by some and disputed by others on technical grounds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No theory has achieved unanimous acceptance; the image's superficiality on fibrils and lack of clear pigment remain central constraints for any valid model.</p>
      </div>

    <section class="section two-col">
      <div class="panel">
        <h2>Textile & Material Evidence</h2>
        <p>The Shroud is woven in a distinctive herringbone twill linen. Fiber analysis, pollen studies, and microscopic examinations have been used to compare the cloth with known textiles of various regions and periods. While some analyses point to Mediterranean origins, interpretations vary by study and methodology.</p>

        <p>Key textile notes:</p>
        <ul class="dot-list">
          <li><strong>Weave:</strong> Herringbone twill; relatively uncommon for everyday burial linens in some periods.</li>
          <li><strong>Fiber traces:</strong> Traces of biological materials, possible blood residues, and environmental particles have been reported (interpretation contested).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Iconography & Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>Whether considered a relic or artifact, the Shroud has profoundly influenced Christian art and popular imagination. Artistic depictions, devotional practices, and pilgrimage traditions reflect its cultural impact beyond purely scientific discourse.</p>

        <p>As an icon, it raises questions about authenticity, representation, and the role of objects in faith communities.</p>
